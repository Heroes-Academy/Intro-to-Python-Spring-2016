Week 1: Hello World
===================

Summary
^^^^^^^

To come after the lesson!

Preview: We'll be talking about the very basics of computers, Python, and programming.

Homework
^^^^^^^^

The homework for this week is to get Python, and PyCharm, installed and working on your home computer. Instructions on how to do so are located in the "Installing Python" section on the left.

Once you've installed Python (the Anaconda version, as shown in the "Installing Python" section), you'll automatically get a program on your computer called QTConsole. You can search for this either by using the Windows key (on a Windows machine) or by searching for it in the Finder (on a Mac). This is the console we used in class - try out some code on your own and see what you can do!

We won't be using PyCharm for a little while, so just see if you can install and open the program - don't worry about making anything with it.

And remember: if you have any difficulty, email me at tmeo@njgifted.org with questions!

===============

Summary
^^^^^^^

To come after the lesson!

Preview: We'll be talking about how to use Booleans (a variable that is either True or False) in code!

In-Class and Homework Exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'll be posting the class summary, lesson slides, and actual homework assignments tomorrow evening.

But first - I want to make sure everyone's PyCharm is working properly, since a few people mentioned they'd had some trouble. Now that we've used PyCharm in class, try using it at home, `following the guide on the Week 3 Github page <https://github.com/Heroes-Academy/Intro-to-Python-Spring-2016/tree/master/code/week3>`_.

Email me back once you've tried it out, and let me know either if it worked, or if you ran into a problem! If you had a problem, just describe what it was, maybe with a screenshot of the issue. We'll work to get it sorted out, and then proceed from there.

Good luck!

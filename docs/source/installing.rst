Installing Python
=================

Python Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several ways to get Python. You should have a flash drive with an installer. In case you don't, the `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ distribution is a great option. It has a bunch of things packaged with it above and beyond Python that make it useful.


An Editor
^^^^^^^^^

There are many good editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). As you're just beginning to learn how to use Python, it's a good idea to use a simplistic, lightweight development environment. `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_ and `Sublime Text <https://sublimetext.com/>`_ are both good choices for starting out. They have nice, clean appearances, highlight your code to make it easier to read, and are easy to jump in and start coding right away. If you download Pycharm, make sure you choose the Community Edition.

Other than those two, GitHub has an editor that is very comparable to Sublime Text.  It is called `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_.

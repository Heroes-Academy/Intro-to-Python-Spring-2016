In-Class and Homework Exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three different exercises for homework this week. They are all ".py" files, so you should open them using PyCharm!

The homework files are located `on the course Github page <https://github.com/Heroes-Academy/Intro-to-Python-Spring-2016/tree/master/code/week2>`. To download a file, right-click on its name and select "Save link as..." then select where you want to save it.

Once you've downloaded the homework files, open PyCharm on your computer. Click "File", then click "Open", and select one of the homework files. (remember, they end in .py) We haven't used PyCharm in class yet, so don't worry - you're just using it to view the homework. As you can see, PyCharm makes reading code way easier than a basic text editor!

Once the file is open, you'll be able to read my instructions (they're always at the top of the file) and go from there.

- formulas.py - Nice and simple! I've written a few formulas for you to try out (like the ones we did in class - area of a circle, etc). See if you can write the code for them in Python!
- strings_practice.py - This one is also pretty quick. 
- harder_formulas.py - This file has a few word problems that you can solve using Python! These are a bit harder, and it's fine if you can't get through them. They're a bonus challenge.

Try to give these a shot by Wednesday, and send me an email with answers and/or questions. You can reach me at tmeo@njgifted.org. If you have trouble getting PyCharm to work, or can't download the files, you can ask me about that too. I'm happy to answer any questions! 

I've included the lecture slides below in case you forget how to do anything we talked about in class. Good luck!!
